# Zomato Restaurant Clustering and Sentimental Analysis

Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.

India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.

# Problem Statement

The problem statement for this project is to analyze and understand the restaurant industry in India by utilizing data from the Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up, Zomato. The project aims to gain insights into the sentiments of customer reviews, cluster Zomato restaurants into different segments, and analyze the data to make useful conclusions in the form of visualizations. The data analyzed includes information on cuisine, costing, and customer reviews. The project aims to assist customers in finding the best restaurant in their locality and aid the company in identifying areas for growth and improvement in the industry. Additionally, the project aims to use the data for sentiment analysis and identifying critics in the industry through the metadata of reviewers.

# Project Summary 

This project entailed the utilization of advanced data analytics techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the restaurants and customer feedback on the popular online food delivery platform, Zomato.

The data procured included information such as the restaurant's name, location, cuisines, average cost for two, ratings, and user reviews.

Subsequently, I embarked on the task of data cleaning and preprocessing, which involved the elimination of duplicate entries, addressing missing values, and transforming the data into a format amenable to analysis.

The next step in the project was the implementation of clustering on the restaurant data through the use of the k-means algorithm. The objective of the clustering was to group similar restaurants together and discern patterns within the data. The features employed for the clustering process included the restaurant's location, cuisines, and average cost for two. The number of clusters was determined by utilizing the elbow method.

I then proceeded to conduct sentiment analysis on the user reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall sentiment towards the restaurants. Certain libraries were utilized to classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

The outcome of the analysis revealed that the restaurants within the city were grouped into five clusters based on their location, cuisines, and average cost for two. The sentiment analysis uncovered that, generally, customers held a positive sentiment towards the restaurants.

# Conclusion

Clustering and sentiment analysis were performed on a dataset of customer reviews for the food delivery service Zomato. The purpose of this analysis was to understand the customer's experience and gain insights about their feedback.

The clustering technique was applied to group customers based on their review text, and it was found that the customers were grouped into two clusters: positive and negative. This provided a general understanding of customer satisfaction levels, with the positive cluster indicating the highest level of satisfaction and the negative cluster indicating the lowest level of satisfaction.

Sentiment analysis was then applied to classify the review text as positive or negative. This provided a more detailed understanding of customer feedback and helped to identify specific areas where the service could be improved.

Overall, this analysis provided valuable insights into the customer's experience with Zomato, and it could be used to guide future business decisions and improve the service. Additionally, by combining clustering and sentiment analysis techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of customer feedback was achieved.
